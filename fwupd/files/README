How to update device firmware

1) Prepare a FAT-formatted SD-Card (should not be larger than 2Gb).
2) Copy onto SD card all the files from this directory
3) Put the SD-Card in the tablet and start it with Vol+ (or Vol-) & Power
4) After a few seconds, a black screen with instructions should appear
5) User Vol+/Vol- buttons to select option "update system from SD card"
6) Use Power button to activate the option and wait for completion (steps shown on screen)
7) When finished, long-press Power button to turn device off, then Power again to restart
8) First Android boot would take several minutes, before reaching the home screen

SUGGESTION

Update firmare only if you already have a safe version, to rollback in case of failure.

NOTES

- two different kernel images are provided:

 uImage4
 uImage4_goodix

First one (installed by default) is for a "PixCir" touchscreen model. 
Some tablets have a "Goodix" touchscreen model, which the second image is built for. 
If your touch panel doesn't receive inputs after udpate, try renaming uImage4_goodix to uImage4 and re-installing firmware.

- Some features are still missing (e.g. HW-accelarated graphics, sound, g-sensor, HDMI out)

- Some bugs may still be present. Known ones:
  - screen goes off without turning off backlight
  - suddenly hanging, sometimes on suspend
  - ...
